To test your Laravel shopping cart implementation and ensure it's working correctly, follow these steps:

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Start Your Laravel Development Server**

If you haven't already:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will typically start your app at:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Visit the Cart Page**

Open your browser and go to:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/cart
```

* This will show the cart (initially empty).
* If you see "Your cart is empty" ‚Äî ‚úÖ this means it's working so far.

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Add a Product**

Go to:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/cart/add
```

* This will **add a Smartphone product to the cart** and redirect back to the cart page.
* You should now see the product in the table.
* Total price should display as `$200`.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Add More Products (Click Again)**

Click `/cart/add` again or refresh that URL ‚Äî the product will be added again.

* You should now see multiple entries of the product.
* Total price updates (e.g., 3 items = \$600).

---

### ‚úÖ **5. Clear the Cart**

Visit:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/cart/clear
```

* This will remove all items from the cart.
* You‚Äôll be redirected to the cart page showing "Your cart is empty."

---

### ‚úÖ **6. Check Session Data (Optional)**

If you want to **debug session data**, you can dump it inside your controller or Blade:

```php
dd(session()->get('cart'));
```

---


Here's a **short summary** explanation of the `CartController` in your Laravel shopping cart app:

---

### üßæ **CartController Summary**

* **`addProduct()`**
  Adds a hardcoded product (Smartphone) to the session cart.
  If the cart doesn‚Äôt exist, it initializes a new one. Then saves it.

* **`showCart()`**
  Retrieves all products from the session cart.
  Calculates the **total price** by summing up the prices of all items.
  Passes data to a Blade view for display.

* **`clearCart()`**
  Deletes the cart data from the session, effectively emptying the cart.
  Then redirects to the cart view.

---

Each method uses Laravel‚Äôs `session()` helper to read/write data, and simple `redirect()` or `view()` functions to respond. It's a basic cart system without database use, ideal for beginners.

Would you like me to explain how to upgrade this to use a database and user authentication later?

| Views not found          | Check filename is `cart.blade.php` in `/resources/views`                  |
| Routes not working       | Make sure routes are in `web.php` and `php artisan route:list` shows them |
| Session not persisting   | Ensure cookies are enabled in browser                                     |
| Laravel not running      | Run `php artisan serve`                                                   |
